The generated JavaScript code includes the following functionality:

1. **Smooth Scroll**: This allows users to smoothly scroll to different sections of the website when clicking on navigation links. It selects all elements with the class "scroll-link", adds a click event listener to each one, and scrolls the window to the target section using the `scrollTo()` method with a smooth behavior.

2. **Form Validation**: This validates the contact form, ensuring that all fields (name, email, and message) are filled out before submitting the form. If any field is empty, it prevents the form from submitting and displays an alert message.

3. **Interactive Project Filters**: This allows users to filter the projects displayed on the page based on their category. It selects all the filter buttons and project elements, and adds a click event listener to each filter button. When a button is clicked, it shows the projects that match the selected category (or all projects if the "all" button is clicked) and hides the rest.

The code is tailored for a Sustainable Fashion portfolio website, ensuring smooth scrolling, form validation, and interactive project filtering functionality. It is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
